		This is a sample web application designed using MVC techniques.
		The application framework is provided by Dancer2.  The
		database is originally SQLite, but we will like to use MySQL in
		later stages of the project.  We are using DBIx to provide
		object-relation mapping.
		</p>
		<p class="color-08-class">
		Eventually, we would like to add session management.  I'd also
		like to play around with different stylesheets.  As mentioned
		earlier, it would be good to switch to MySQL.  I also want to
		see if I can both use docker containers and possibly build a
		custom image for this web application.
		</p>
		<p class="color-12-class">
		If we're talking really advanced stuff, we can incorporate
		some memcache servers (use docker?) or a redis system (
		either for sessions, or for general back-end database?)
